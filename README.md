Official repository of unofficial RHUL Calendar notificator.  

This project was created as an alternative to receiving notifications 
about events that an ordinary student can look at [webtimetables.royalholloway.ac.uk](
https://webtimetables.royalholloway.ac.uk) or by adding it to their calendar (Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.).

#### Commands

With every new version of the bot, telegram would automatically add commands to command list in chat with bot 
if there would be new ones.

Commands for bot version - **+0.0.1**

| Command | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `/currentevents` | Bot sends a message about the event that is taking place at the moment. If there aren't any events at the moment - you would receive corresponded message. |
| `/todayevents` | Bot sends a message with all events that would be during the day and adds link to webpage with your calendar. <br>That link you can share with anyone, so they would know what you have "today".|
| `/tomorrowevents` | Bot sends a message with all events that would be during next day and adds link to webpage with your calendar. <br>That link you can share with anyone, so they would know what you have "tomorrow".|
| `/weekevents` | Bot sends a message with all events that would be during current week and adds link to webpage with your calendar. <br>That link you can share with anyone, so they would know what you have during "week".|

| `/notifon` | Turn on notifications from the bot |

The bot is under development. More commands expect in the near future.


## For developer, curious people

Bot is under development. Currently, you can't fully use bot (some important files I hide),
however you can see the code. You're free to express your ideas.


## For RHUL:

One thing that I learned: if you're looking for something - you would find.  

Here are letters(lowercase)/numbers/symbols. Use these lines to find me.

First name of my tutor - `$2a$10$ZG7WycCSK6gAtxien4woW.Pc/sC5D2RklUaiDuRq8aBv9UIQxlE66`   
My studentID - `$2a$10$y3snDdhSKX.8gly3.b/H3uP9b32civHJULzRcgHKR0.BTRUxC8112`
